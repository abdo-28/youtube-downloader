# youtube-downloader
youtube downloader mainly using python and yt-dlp

gonna work on later but repo just exists for now

main motivation is cuz I need me an efficient way to get stuff off of youtube music that isn't just using the cli cuz it is too cumbersome

extremely scuffed at the moment

---

## To-do

[] - add gui
[] - use mutagen or eyed3 to embed metadata onto the files instead of yt_dlp's weird integration of ffmpeg
[] - maybe learn how to fetch the video data off of youtube instead of relying on yt_dlp
