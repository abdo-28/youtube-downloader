# youtube-downloader
youtube downloader mainly using python and yt-dlp

main motivation is cuz I need me an efficient way to get stuff off of youtube music that isn't just using the cli cuz it is too cumbersome

currently at a state I am happy with when it comes to the backend
but it for sure can be a lot better

---

## To-do

~- [x] - use mutagen or eyed3 to embed metadata onto the files instead of yt_dlp's weird integration of ffmpeg~
  using mutagen
- [ ] - add gui
- [ ] - maybe learn how to fetch the video data off of youtube instead of relying on yt_dlp
